# MinistryFinanceArrays
I have developed a simple JavaScript program, like if it was for the Ministry of Finance, using arrays. 

It has four functionalities:  

a) It enables you to enter your ID, civil state and incomes. 
b) It shows you some statistics about the data of the taxpayers. 
c) It shows you statistics about the taxes each citizen has to pay according a given parammeters. 
d) It implements a simple system of prior appointment.
